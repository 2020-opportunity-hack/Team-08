## Overview
----
#### **Requirements:**
- Need to create a mentor-mentee matching algorithm and platform
- Currently students are matched mentors via manual methods
- Need a more sophisticated way to match metors to mentees in larger quantities

#### **Criterion to consider:**
After holding multiple meetings with the Greenwood staff, we finalized a few important criteria that the algorithm must consider:

- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Technical expertise (powerpoint, excel, word)
- Industry Specialization
- Educational background (High School or College)


<br />

## Proposal
----
- We propose a three step plan that caters to both, Greenwoods immedieate and long term needs.
- Step 1 (Prototyped): Match making ALgorithm and UI
  - Due to the lack of digitised data, a amchine learning model is currently unfeasible. Therefore, we planned and coded an algorithm that weights each criterion respectfully
