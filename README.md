## Overview
----
#### **Requirements:**
- Need to create mentor matching algorithm and platform
- Currently students numbers are manually matcedh to mentors
- Need a more sophisticated way to match mentosr to mentees to process larger amounts of data

#### **Inputs to consider:**
Some of the parameters to consider to make an effective match:

- Ethnicity
- Industry Specialization
- Shared educational background (High School or College)
- Location
- Gender

Apart from above generic parameters, there are some tags attached to each profile which also can be considered to create a match

<br />

## Proposal
----
- When signing up for the project, mentor and mentee both enters their personal details which then be used as parameters to consider for matching
- Once user sign-in to the app, they will have access to recommended match provided by the system
- User can update parameters to filter out matches from the recommended choice
- User also has option to override the system recommended matches and add manual filters to serach for match of their choice
