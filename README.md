## Overview
----
#### **Requirements:**
- Need to create a mentor-mentee matching algorithm and platform
- Currently students are matched mentors via manual methods
- Need a more sophisticated way to match metors to mentees in larger quantities

#### **Inputs to consider:**
Some of the parameters to consider to make an effective match:

- Ethnicity
- Industry Specialization
- educational background (High School or College)
- Gender

Apart from above generic parameters, there are some tags attached to each profile which also can be considered to create a match

<br />

## Proposal
----
- When signing up for the project, mentor and mentee both enter their personal details which then will be used as parameters considered for matching
- Once users sign-in to the app, they will have access to recommendeded match sprovided by the algorithm
- Users can update preference parameters to alter the reccomendation algorithm results to get more personalized matches
- Users also have the option to override the system recommended matches and add manual filters to serach for match of their choice
